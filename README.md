*YOU MIGHT KNOW ME AS `YURI-DABANG`, BUT NOW I AM `Yuri-Is-On-Rage-Mode`*

## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I'm a FURIOUS programmer with tons of cool projects. My GitHub account Yuri-DaBang got hacked on 21-JULY-2024 😡🤬, and I'm on a revenge spree! I've made seven programming languages and mastered Python 🐍. Besides coding, I'm sharpening my hacking skills and fighting moves—think of me as a digital ninja with a keyboard and a black belt 🥋💻. I love learning, sharing, and causing some chaos, especially in awesome, team-driven projects.

## 👀 Interests
Hacking that jerk who stole my account 😤💻🔨. BTW, I love programming! Check out my previous work on `https://github.com/Yuri-DaBang`. I enjoy exploring new technologies, algorithms, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
Hacking and fighting skills like jujitsu and karate 🥋🥊 to fight for my account! Also diving deep into `system architecture`, `API magic`, and advanced 🧠 `machine learning algorithms`.

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate On
Hacking that thief's whole life 🔥💻😈! Also, open-source projects, groundbreaking AI research, and tools to make programming more accessible and efficient.

## 📫 How to Reach Me
You can send a digital owl 🦉 to `hamzasufyanmacrohard@gmail.com` or connect with me on Patreon at `patreon.com/akaYuri`. BTW, I still use the username Yuri everywhere, and I'm not thrilled about it 😤🔥.

## 😄 Pronouns
He/Him, but you can also call me "The Freedom Fighter" 🥋🦸‍♂️ or "Python Master" 🐍 if you’re feeling brave! I’m currently fighting for my account like a coding gladiator.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I’m knee-deep in the battle for my account and love solving complex puzzles 🧩. I mix humor with code because why not make programming an epic adventure full of drama and laughter? 😂💥
